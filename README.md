## What's Working
- Basic 3x3 board - Priority 1
- Game is always solvable - Priority 1
- Board size based on user input - Priority 2
- Save and display a table with the highest results* - Priority 2
- LocalStorage of game and top 5- Priority 3
* Highest results - There is no real way to calculate the total top 5 because of the different board sizes - a bigger board will take longer to solve. As a result, I decided to show a table with the 5 latest entries instead.
## TODO
- Image Mode - Priority 3
- User Image Upload - Priority 4
- Upload game state from local drive - Priority 4
